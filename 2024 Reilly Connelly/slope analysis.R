# We use ANCOVA because it allows us to compare the slopes of the relationship 
# between species richness and connectance while controlling for the effect of region. 
# Unlike simply comparing individual regression slopes, ANCOVA accounts for both the 
# differences in the slopes and the intercepts between the regions. This test combines 
# the effects of both the categorical variable (region) and the continuous variable
# (species richness) in a single model, providing a more robust and accurate 
# comparison. By doing this, ANCOVA helps us determine if the relationship between 
# species richness and connectance differs significantly between regions, 
# while controlling for the influence of region itself.

# If the interaction term is significant (as it is in your model, 0.00858 **), 
# it means the slopes are significantly different between the regions, and 
# we don't need to rely on comparing confidence intervals manually. 
# The p-value for the interaction term provides the formal statistical test 
# for this difference.

# Linear mixed model ------------------------------------------------------

# and region affect connectance (connect), while accounting for variability across 
# stream orders as a random effect.

model <- lmer(connect ~ num_spec * region + (1 | stream_order), data = data)

# The model shows that stream order contributes very little variance (0.0002), 
# meaning its random effect is minimal. The fixed effects suggest that species 
# number (num_spec) has a weak negative effect on connectance, while tropical 
# regions (regiontropical) have a small, non-significant positive effect. 
# However, the interaction (num_spec:regiontropical) is significant (p â‰ˆ 0.03), 
# suggesting that the effect of species number on connectance differs by region. 
# Overall, species richness and region impact connectance, but stream order has a 
# negligible influence.
